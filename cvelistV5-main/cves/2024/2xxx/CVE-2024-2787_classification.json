    "reasoning": "The CVE relates to a vulnerability in the 'Happy Addons for Elementor' plugin for WordPress. While WordPress utilizes PHP for its core functionality, the specific nature of the vulnerability (Stored Cross-Site Scripting) points to a weakness in how user input is handled and sanitized within the plugin's code.
