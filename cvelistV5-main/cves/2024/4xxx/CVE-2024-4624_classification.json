    "reasoning": "The CVE details mention a WordPress plugin ('Essential Addons for Elementor') and references a PHP file path ('plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/essential-addons-for-elementor-lite/tags/5.9.19/includes/Traits/Elements.php'). WordPress is primarily built with PHP, and the file path strongly suggests PHP code is involved in the vulnerability."
