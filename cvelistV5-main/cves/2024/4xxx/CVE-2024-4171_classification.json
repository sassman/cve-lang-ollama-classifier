    "programming_language": "unknown",
    "cve_id": "CVE-2024-4171",
    "reasoning": "The CVE description mentions a vulnerability in the function \"fromWizardHandle\" of the file \"/goform/WizardHandle\". While this might suggest C/C++ due to the file extension, the description focuses on a stack-based buffer overflow, which is a common vulnerability in many languages, not just C/C++. Without more specific code analysis, it's impossible to definitively determine the programming language involved."
