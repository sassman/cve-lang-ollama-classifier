    "programming_language": "php",
    "cve_id": "CVE-2024-4891",
    "reasoning": "The CVE details mention a WordPress plugin ('Essential Blocks â€“ Page Builder Gutenberg Blocks, Patterns & Templates'). WordPress is primarily built using PHP.  Additionally, the references point to files within the plugin's source code (e.g., plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/essential-blocks/trunk/blocks/AdvancedHeading.php#L115) which further solidify the association with PHP."
