    "reasoning": "The CVE description mentions a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the function 'formwrlSSIDget' of a file named '/goform/wifiSSIDget'.  This strongly suggests the vulnerability exists in C code due to the nature of stack management and buffer overflow exploits being common in C programming. Additionally, the CVE is related to a WiFi router, and firmware for such devices is often written in C due to its efficiency and low-level control."
