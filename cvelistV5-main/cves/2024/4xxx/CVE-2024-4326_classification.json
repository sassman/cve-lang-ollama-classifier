    "cve_id": "CVE-2024-4326",
    "reasoning": "The CVE description mentions web endpoints (`/apply_settings` and `/execute_code`) and a web UI, suggesting it relates to web development technologies rather than a specific programming language. It's possible the vulnerability stems from misconfigurations or insecure libraries used in the web application, rather than a flaw in a particular language's syntax or runtime."
